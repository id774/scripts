# setup_scripts.sh: Setup Script for Scripts Collection
#
#  Description:
#  This script sets permissions for a collection of scripts.
#  - Grants read/write permissions to the owner, and read-only to group and others.
#  - Grants execute permissions to all files with .sh, .py, or .rb extensions under the entire collection.
#  - Grants execute permissions to all files under scripts/cron/bin regardless of extension.

#
#  Usage:
#      ./setup_scripts.sh
#
#  Run this script to set up the permissions for a collection of scripts.
#  Ensure that the SCRIPTS environment variable is set to the path of
#  your script collection before running this script.
#
#  Notes:
#  - This script should be run from the root directory of the script collection.
#  - Make sure to back up your scripts before running this script as a precaution.
#  - SCRIPTS environment variable must be set to the path of the script collection.
#  - Execute permissions will be added:
#      - To all *.sh, *.py, *.rb files under the SCRIPTS path
#      - To all files under scripts/cron/bin (no extension filter)
#
#  Version History:
#  v2.1 2025-06-23
#       Unified usage output to display full script header and support common help/version options.
#       Add execute permission handling for test directory scripts with .sh, .py, or .rb extensions.
#  v2.0 2025-06-16
#       Add execute permission handling for all files under scripts/installer.
#  v1.9 2025-05-12
#       Replace chmod -R with find-based permission control for finer safety.
#       Grant execute permissions to all files under scripts/cron/bin regardless of extension.
#  v1.8 2025-04-25
#       Add INFO log before each permission operation to improve clarity.
#       Verify all return codes to ensure successful completion before final message.
#       Output [ERROR] message if any permission operation fails.
#  v1.7 2025-04-12
#       Revoke execute permissions from scripts/cron/bin to avoid
#       accidental manual execution of cron job scripts.
#  v1.6 2025-03-22
#       Unify usage information by extracting help text from header comments.
#  v1.5 2025-03-17
#       Encapsulated all logic in functions and introduced main function.
#  v1.4 2025-03-13
#       Redirected error messages to stderr for better logging and debugging.
#  v1.3 2024-01-07
#       Updated command existence and execution permission checks
#       using a common function for enhanced reliability and maintainability.
#  v1.2 2023-12-23
#       Refactored for POSIX compliance. Replaced Bash-specific syntax
#       with POSIX standard commands and structures. Enhanced portability
#       and compatibility across different UNIX-like systems.
#  v1.1 2023-12-08
#       Added documentation and environment variable check for SCRIPTS.
#  v1.0 2008-08-22
