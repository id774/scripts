# install_google_chrome.sh: Install and Configure Google Chrome on Debian
#
#  Description:
#  This script installs Google Chrome Stable on Debian (validated on Debian 13)
#  and keeps it managed by APT. It performs the following actions:
#    1) Verify the environment (Linux, required commands, network reachability,
#       and sudo privilege).
#    2) Ensure APT infrastructure directories exist.
#    3) Fetch the latest Google Linux signing key, dearmor it to a keyring,
#       and compare its fingerprint with the currently installed keyring
#       (/usr/share/keyrings/google-linux.gpg). If missing, unreadable, or
#       fingerprint-mismatched, the keyring is (re)installed. This makes the
#       system self-heal after a key rotation or corruption.
#    4) Configure the official Google Chrome repository via a dedicated
#       sources.list.d entry with a signed-by option pointing to the keyring.
#       If a compatible line is already present, it is left as-is.
#    5) Install Google Chrome Stable only when it is not already installed.
#
#  Note:
#    This script intentionally does not run `apt update`. Ensure package
#    metadata is refreshed by your regular operations before running it.
#
#  Design goals:
#    - Idempotence: running the script multiple times converges to a stable
#      configuration without harmful side effects.
#    - Safety: key handling includes fingerprint comparison to gracefully
#      recover from key rotations.
#    - Minimal changes: no aggressive cleanup of existing repo lines; only the
#      expected configuration is added or updated when absent.
#
#  Requirements:
#    - Linux system with: sudo, awk, uname, cp, rm, mktemp, curl, gpg, tee, apt, grep, mkdir, dpkg
#    - Network connectivity to dl.google.com
#    - Sudo privilege for system modifications

#
#  Options:
#  -h   Display this help message (prints the header block).
#
#  Version History:
#  v1.1 2025-09-04
#       Add keyring fingerprint comparison and automatic replacement if the
#       existing key is missing, unreadable, or mismatched. Skip apt install
#       when google-chrome-stable is already installed.
#  v1.0 2025-09-04
#       Initial release for Debian 13. Add Google repo (signed-by) and install
#       google-chrome-stable via apt with idempotent behavior.
