# setup_rsyslog_logrotate.sh: Enforce daily and rotate 90 for rsyslog
#
#  Description:
#    This script makes sure /etc/logrotate.d/rsyslog contains, inside
#    every brace block `{ ... }`, the two directives below with a
#    four-space indent:
#        "    daily"
#        "    rotate 90"
#    If a block already has a frequency directive (daily/weekly/monthly/
#    yearly), it is normalized to "    daily". If a block already has
#    "rotate N", it is normalized to "    rotate 90". If either directive
#    is missing, it is inserted immediately before the closing brace.

#
#  Usage:
#      ./setup_rsyslog_logrotate.sh
#      ./setup_rsyslog_logrotate.sh -h   # prints this header
#
#  Why this approach:
#    * Idempotent: running the script multiple times does not keep
#      changing the file once it is in the desired state.
#    * Safe metadata handling: updated content is copied back with cp -p
#      to preserve mode/owner/timestamps.
#    * Minimal edits: only the target directives are touched; everything
#      else (delaycompress, postrotate, comments, ordering) is preserved.
#
#  Beginner notes:
#    * "logrotate" reads configuration files describing how to rotate
#      (rename and compress) logs. rsyslog writes system logs such as
#      /var/log/auth.log and /var/log/syslog. Placing "daily" reduces
#      each fileâ€™s size by rotating every day; "rotate 90" keeps 90
#      generations (roughly 90 days).
#    * We first normalize tabs to four spaces so indentation looks
#      consistent across editors and diffs. Then we fix each block.
#    * Temporary files are written under /tmp and removed via a trap.
#
#  Behavior summary:
#    1) If the file contains any tab characters, replace all tabs with
#       four spaces (single pass).
#    2) In each brace block:
#         - normalize daily/weekly/monthly/yearly => "    daily"
#         - insert "    daily" if missing
#         - normalize "rotate N"                 => "    rotate 90"
#         - insert "    rotate 90" if missing
#    3) After changes, print the final file to the screen and a clear
#       concluding message.
#
#  Requirements:
#    - Linux
#    - sudo privileges (script uses sudo for reading/writing the target)
#    - Commands: sudo, awk, cp, cmp, grep, cat, rm
#
#  Error Conditions:
#  0. Success
#  1. General failure (OS check, sudo, file missing, awk failure, etc.)
#  126. Required command(s) not executable.
#  127. Required command(s) not installed.
#
#  Version History:
#  v1.0 2025-09-29
#       Initial release.
