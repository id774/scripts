#  This file is sourced by the caller to manage dynamic Munin symlinks

#  - This file must be POSIX sh compatible.
#  - Do not add a shebang; this file is sourced, not executed.
#
#  Variables:
#  - TIME_THRESHOLD: Time in seconds to consider a server as alive.
#  - RECEIVED_DIR:   Directory where *_is_alive files are received.
#  - MUNIN_CONF_DIR: Directory where symlinks for Munin are placed.
#  - ACTIVE_DIR:     Directory containing actual config files to link.
#  - SERVER_LIST:    Newline separated list of monitored servers.
#
#  Example:
#    TIME_THRESHOLD=600
#    RECEIVED_DIR="/home/share/received"
#    MUNIN_CONF_DIR="/etc/munin/munin-conf.d"
#    ACTIVE_DIR="/etc/munin/server-available"
