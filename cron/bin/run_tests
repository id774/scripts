# run_tests: Automated Testing Script for Python and Ruby projects
#
#  Description:
#  This script automates the process of running tests for projects developed
#  in Python and Ruby. It loads configuration settings from an external '.conf'
#  file, iterates through specified versions of Python and Ruby to run tests,
#  and performs a compatibility check using the last Python version in the loop.
#  It is intended to be executed automatically via cron jobs and sends a summary
#  email to an administrator upon completion.

#
#  Version History:
#  v1.4 2025-04-28
#       Add execution of test/check_scripts.sh after Python and Ruby tests if available.
#       Fully refactor run_tests into function-based structure.
#  v1.3 2025-04-13
#       Unify log level formatting using [INFO], [WARN], and [ERROR] tags.
#  v1.2 2025-03-19
#       Improved POSIX compliance, standardized logging, and enhanced
#       readability through function encapsulation.
#  v1.1 2024-04-08
#       Made ADMIN_MAIL_ADDRESS optional for email notifications.
#  v1.0 2024-03-13
#       Initial release. Features include dynamic version testing for Python
#       and Ruby, external configuration loading, and compatibility checking.
#
#  Usage:
#  This script is designed to be run automatically through a cron job. Ensure
#  that 'run_tests.conf' is properly configured with the SCRIPTS, JOBLOG,
#  python_versions, ruby_versions, and ADMIN_MAIL_ADDRESS variables. For manual
#  execution, run the script:
#      ./run_tests
#
#  The script iterates through the specified versions, runs tests for each
#  combination of Python and Ruby versions, concludes with a compatibility
#  check using the last Python version tested, and sends a summary email to
#  the administrator.
#
#  Configuration file ('run_tests.conf') requirements:
#  - SCRIPTS: Path to the scripts directory.
#  - JOBLOG: Path to the job log file.
#  - python_versions: Space-separated list of Python versions to test.
#  - ruby_versions: Space-separated list of Ruby versions to test.
#  - ADMIN_MAIL_ADDRESS: Email address of the administrator to notify.
#  Ensure these variables are set in 'run_tests.conf'.
#
#  Notes:
#  - The script is designed to be run in environments where Python and Ruby
#    are used for development and testing.
#  - Ensure the specified Python and Ruby versions are installed and accessible.
#
#  Error Conditions:
#  0. All tests completed successfully.
#  1. Some tests failed.
#  3. Configuration file not found.
#  4. Configuration variables not set.
